        Description of the GOSH backend for the Latex Beamer Package

                            Ronald Aigner

The style 'beamer.gosh' and 'beamer-split.gosh' allow to generate slides from
a GOSH file using the latex-beamer style.  There are some restriction on how
to format the text:
* The Beamer style displays short names of the current part of the
  presentation.  For these parts we use the chapter. Therefore use short
  descriptive names with chapters.
* One chapter title is reserved: 'Outline'. Writing a single outline chapter
  will generate the outline slide in the presentation. Leave this chapter
  empty. Using a dedicated chapter allows you to palce the outline wherever
  you like.
* To assign the title of a slide, use the section heading.
* You may also use the subsection heading to generate a slide. The main
  difference to a section is the placement in the outline.
* You may use pictures just as you would with the main latex style.
* To generate listings with grayed items where the items are displayed with
  the next click, insert the 'pause' command after an item (Don't forget to
  write the backslash before 'pause'.)


Example:
########

! * foo
!
! Second Part
! ###########
!
! Third Slide
! ===========
!
! * bla
!
! Forth Slide
! ===========

! * blubb

To generate the respective latex file use:

! gosh --style /where/gosh/lives/techreport.gosh \
!      your_paper.txt > your_paper.tex

Now simply run pdflatex with the resulting tex file. Don't forget to install
the 'latex-beamer' package!
